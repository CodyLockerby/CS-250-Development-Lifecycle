How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs you must first define them by adding them to the product backlog. From there you can assing a priority and a size to the task. Creating users stories give more detail to the testers and what the final goal of the task is.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The first step is to ensure a good meeting occurs with the client so all needs and requirements are communicated properly. From there we can begin daily scrums and sprint estimation tactics to ensure the work is completed well and on time.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is someone who communicates properly and efficeinently. This means that when they are falling behind they let someone know so perhaps help can be given to keep the project moving along smoothly
